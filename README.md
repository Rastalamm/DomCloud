DomCloud
========

Build a program to recursively traverse the DOM and create a word cloud of most common attributes and elements to create a tag cloud.

**index.html** contains sample html, you will be parsing this as your sample dom tree, and this is your main javascript launcher.  
You have access to jasmine and jquery.

## Part 1
  
- Plan your execution on white board before forking and cloning.
- Write a program that will recursively traverse the DOM and create a word list of the 20 most common attributes and elements
- Print the results in #dom_cloud_container
- Each word should be a different size based on itâ€™s popularity

## Part 2
  
- Create a bookmarklet that will parse the currently opened page, and generate a tag cloud on a new layer in the current window.

## File structure
  - index.html
  - js/dom_cloud.js
  - js/jasmine-2.0.0
  - css/styles.css
